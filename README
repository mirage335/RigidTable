_Stackup_
From top to bottom. All layers 30"x40", see dimensions.
1) Dual 3/4" melamine particle board.
2) Vertically oriented finished lumber, approximating 2x4's.
3) Melamine particle board, 3/4".
4) Styrofoam insulation panel, for noise dampening.

_Usage_
Similar tables can easily be built with careful measurement, plenty of deck screws, and carefully selected wood products from a local hardware store (notably HomeDepot).

Do NOT join the vertically oriented finished lumber segments internally (through the sides), as this may torque the top surface.

_Performance_
Flatness much better than 0.25mm across the entire 30"x40" surface has been maintained for several weeks. No discernable deformation occurrs under >150lbs loads.

_Dimensions_
Table is 30"x40" wide, to accomodate a LulzBot Taz derived CNC machine with the following specifications.

4" Equipent Area (Y-axis)
12" Clearance (All Axes)
18" x 24" Build Area

Mounting at ~36" height is recommended, to place a LulzBot Taz build surface at eye level for easy leveling.
